# r0x57n.github.io
This is where I store my [website](https://0x57.me). It's hosted with [github pages](https://pages.github.com/), [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and uses the [klis√©](https://github.com/piharpi/jekyll-klise) theme (modified).

## Start a local version
From root folder, run `docker compose up`. Once started you can reach the website on [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000/).
