* r0x57n.github.io
This is where I store my [[https://0x57.me][website]]. It's hosted with [[https://pages.github.com/][github pages]], [[https://jekyllrb.com/][jekyll]] and uses the [[https://github.com/piharpi/jekyll-klise][klise]] theme (modified).

** Start a local version
From root folder, run ~docker compose up~. Once started you can reach the website on [[http://localhost:4000][localhost:4000]].
